## compare it to its next door right neighbor and swap if necessary
## repeat, moving to the right of the array, until the "next door right neighbor" just
## processed was the last element to be sorted - that element is now "sorted" and does
## not need to be visited again - this is one iteration

## iterate, sorting to one less array position each time.
