# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version contol is a system that has a record of all the versions of a file or set of files.  It is useful because you can recall certain versions later when you need them.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a way to continue doing your work without messing up the main work.  It is helpful so that you don't mess up the main work and can merge the work done in the branches to the main work.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* Commit is a way to comment what changes have been made. A detailed message of what changes or additions have made to the file so that anyone can understand what is in the file.
* What is a merge conflict?
* If you change the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you're merging together, it won't be able to merge them cleanly.
